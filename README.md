##  Installation
To use the scripts and notebooks, you first need to install some things. If conda is already installed, ignore steps 1-2.

For more detailed instructions on how to install `conda`, see [this page](https://teamncmc.github.io/histoquant/main-getting-started.html#python-virtual-environment-manager-conda).

1. Install [Miniforge](https://conda-forge.org/download/) (choose the latest version for your system) as user, add conda to PATH and make it the default interpreter.
1. Open a terminal (PowerShell in Windows) and run `conda init`. Restart the terminal.
1. Create a virtual environment named "ffd" :
    ```bash
    conda create -n ffd python=3.12
    ```
1. Activate the environment :
    ```bash
    conda activate ffd
    ```
1. Install the package and its dependencies :
    ```bash
    pip install features-from-dlc
    ```

You should be ready to use the scripts and notebooks !

To use the scripts, see the [Usage](#usage) section.

To use the notebooks, two options :
- Use an IDE with Jupyter notebooks support such as [Visual Studio Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/download). Install the Python and Jupyter extensions (the squared pieces on the left panel). Open the notebook with vscode, on the top right you should be able to select a kernel : choose "ffd".
- Use Jupyter directly in its web browser interface : from the terminal, activate the conda environment : `conda activate ffd`, then launch Jupyter : `jupyter lab /path/to/the/notebooks/notebook.ipynb`

## Update
To update, simply activate your environment (`conda activate ffd`) and run :
```bash
pip install features-from-dlc --upgrade
```

## In-depth description of `features_from_dlc`

### Introduction
This package is meant to be used to compute and display features from DeepLabCut (DLC) tracking files.

It will process a bunch of h5 or csv files created by DLC, computing so called "features" that are arbitrarily defined by the user and displaying them in nice graphs : time series with averages and errors, corresponding bar plots that quantifies a change during a specified epoch (typically, an optogenetic stimulation), response delays and response rate. 
It is intended to be modular : the main module (`features_from_dlc`) merely loads DLC files, computes features, averages them per condition and plots them. So-called configuration files are plugged into it and specifies _how_ the features are computed from the bodyparts tracked in DLC.  
Anyone can write its own configuration file to compute any required features (such as speed, body angle, jaw opening, you name it), as long as the original syntax is respected.

#### Tip
You don't have to read this document entirely to get started, you can jump to the [Getting started](#getting-started), [Requirements](#requirements) or [Usage](#usage) sections.

#### Use case
The use case is :
- I have DLC files that tracks bodyparts "a", "b" and "c" (eg. "nose", "body", "tail").
- I want to compute and display features "x" and "y" (eg. "speed", "body angle"), that are derived from "a", "b" and "c".
- Those features should be averaged and compared across conditions and/or animals.
- There is a stimulation in my experiment and I want to quantify the change of behavior during the stimulation.

#### Modularity
The attempt to make this modular is the idea that the principle is always the same : load files, compute features, average across animals and conditions and plot the result. What actually differs from experiment to experiment and people to people is _how_ to compute the required features and the experimental conditions, such as the pixel size in the videos, the framerate and the timings of the stimulation. So all the later are defined in a separate configuration file that is experiment- and people-specific and plugged into the main script.

### How-to  
#### Getting started
Follow the instructions in the [Quick start](#quick-start) section. Then, the idea is to edit the example script and configuration files before running it your data. In principle you can do that with any text editor, but it is recommended to use an IDE for ease of use. You can use any of your liking, below is explained how to use Visual Studio Code.

Note that after installation, the `features_from_dlc` package is installed inside the conda environment. The `features_from_dlc` folder is not used anymore, rather, we will use a script to import the package and use it on the data. The `ffd_quantify.py` script located in `examples/` is a template you can copy and modify as needed.

##### Visual Studio Code
It's easier to use as conda is nicely integrated and it is made easy to switch between environments.
1. Install [vscode](https://code.visualstudio.com/download) (it does not require admin rights).
1. Install Python extension (squared pieces in the left panel).
1. Open the `examples/ffd_quantify.py` script. In the bottom right corner, you should see a "conda" entry : click on it and select the ffd conda environment. To run the script, click on the Play icon on the top right.

#### Requirements
You need to have tracked your video clips with DeepLabCut and saved the output files (either .h5 or .csv files). One file corresponds to one and only one trial, so you might need to split your original videos into several short clips around the stimulation onsets and offsets beforehand. This can be done with [`videocutter` program](https://github.com/TeamNCMC/videocutter). All files analyzed together must :
- all be in the same directory,
- be individual trials with the same duration and the stimulation must occur at the same timings,
- have consistent file names. In particular, those file names must :
  - start with the subject (animal) ID,
  - contains _something_ that allows to group those files into different categories. Those are called *conditions*. For instance, if you want to compare several animals at different laser power, their file names must contain something that identify that power, for example, all trials corresponding to 10mW will have "10mW" somewhere in their file names, while all trials corresponding to "20mW" will have "20mW" somewhere in their file names. Therefore, in that case, a file can not have both "10mW" and "20mW" in its filename. Of course, this applies for any conditions. Be cautious, "5mW" and "25mW" as different conditions  won't work because "5mW" will appear in both groups, so you need to find a workaround (for instance the 5mW group could be identified with "_5mW").

You also need a configuration file. It defines the features one wants to extract, the metrics that quantify the change during stimulation, the thresholds used to filter incorrect tracks and some display parameters (axes names). See [The configuration file](#the-configuration-file).

Optionnaly, you can have a settings.toml file next to the DLC files to analyze. It specifies the experimental settings (timings and pixel size). If the file does not exist, default values from the configuration file will be used instead. See [The settings.toml file](#the-settingstoml-file).

#### Usage
1. Copy-paste the `examples/ffd_quantify.py` file elsewhere on your computer, open it with an editor.
1. Fill the `--- Parameters ---` section. This includes :
   - `directory` : the full path to the directory containing the *files to be analyzed*.
   - `configs_path` : the full path to the directory containing the *configuration files* (eg. `modality.py` and `config_plot.toml`).
   - `modality` : It corresponds to a configuration file. It will look for a python file with this name in the `configs_path` directory.
   - `animals` : a tuple (`(a, b, c)`, or `(a, )` for single element). Only files beginning by those will be processed (case-sensitive).
   - `conditions` : a dictionary (`{key1: values1, key2: values2}`). This maps a condition name ("key1", "key2" will appear on the graphs) to a _filter_. This filter is used to assign a file to a condition based on its file name. The beginning of the file name has priority, if it begins by something in the values, it is assigned to the corresponding condition, whether there is another match somewhere else in the file name.  
   Examples :  
       `conditions = {"control": ["animal70"], "low": ["10mW"], "high": ["20mW"]}`  
       filename -> condition :  
       animal70_10mW_blabla.h5 -> "control"  
       animal70_20mW_blabla.h5 -> "control"  
       animal71_10mW_blabla.h5 -> "low"  
       animal81_20mW_blabla.h5 -> "high"
    - `paired_tests` : Whether the conditions are paired or not, eg. if the same subject appears in several conditions, in which case all pairs of conditions should involve at least one time the same animal.
1. Fill the `- Outputs` section. Specify the directory where to put the results (summary and figures) by setting the `outdir` variable.
1. Fill the `- Options` section. Those are the display options, eg. what to plot and how. The `plot_options` should be a dictionnary with the following keys :
   - `plot_pooled`: `None` or a list of conditions (`["a"]` or `["a", "b"]`). Conditions whose trials are pooled to plot a pooled mean and sem. Useful when conditions are "Control" and "Injected" for example. If `None`, this is not plotted.
   - `plot_trials`: `True` or `False`. Whether to plot individual trials. When there are a lot, it's a good idea not to show them to not clutter the graphs.
   - `plot_condition`: `True` or `False`. Whether to plot mean and sem per condition.
   - `plot_animals`: `True` or `False`. Whether to plot mean and sem per animal.
   - `plot_animals_monochrome`: `True` or `False`. Whether to plot each animals in the same color.
   - `plot_condition_off`: `None` or a list. List of conditions NOT to be plotted. Does not apply for the raster plots nor the bar plots next to the time series.
   - `plot_delay_list`: List of conditions whose delay will be displayed in the figure.
   - `style_file`: full path to the plot configuration file that specifies the graphs colors, linewidths...
1. Check the modality.py configuration file. In particular, check that `PIXEL_SIZE`, `STIM_TIME` and `CLIP_DURATION` correspond to your experimental conditions if a settings.toml file is not provided with the DLC files to be analyzed. Also check that `BODYPARTS` contains all the bodyparts used to compute features. Check that the thresholds defined in the `--- Data cleaning parameters` section make sense.
1. Run the script ! Make sure you activated the `ffd` conda environment.

Alternatively, you can also just display the plots from data previously processed. To do so, comment out the call to `ffd.process_directory` and uncomment the following block.

#### The configuration file
This file actually defines how are computed the requested features. An example for openfield experiments is provided in the `configs` folder. In case you want to write your own, you should start from there.

Note that those files are *very* specific : they use DLC bodyparts directly so the latter need to exist in the tracking file (eg. bodyparts should be named _exactly_ the same and correspond to _exactly_  the same bodypart). All the variables in here are used in the main script, so they all need to be defined, while imports will depend on what is needed. If you don't want to actually use them, you need to find a trick so that the functionnality is disabled but the script is still working.

This file consists in some variables defined at the top of the file, and a Python Class defining a "Config" object. This object has some required attributes and methods. Below is the extensive description of all variables.

##### Global variables
###### Physical parameters
This is where we convert images to real-world units. Those values are used only if they are missing from the settings.toml file placed next to the DLC files to analyze or if it does not exist.
- `PIXEL_SIZE`: Conversion factor from image coordinates to real-world length, expressed in unit of length (eg. mm). To measure that, you can open a video in Fiji (File > Import > Movie (FFMPEG)). Then with the Line tool, measure in pixels the length of a known object. Then, `PIXEL_SIZE` will be $length_{mm}/length_{pixels}$, optionally averaging two conversions in the horizontal and vertical directions.
- `CLIP_DURATION`: Duration of the video clips, in units of time (eg. seconds). Each DLC file contains $n_{frames}$ lines, so we use that to convert frames to real-world time.
- `STIM_TIME`: tuple with 2 elements. The onset and offset of the stimulation in the video clip, in the same units as `CLIP_DURATION`.
- `FRAMERATE`: This is **not** the actual framerate of the videos. It is used to create a generic time vector on which the time series are aligned, so that we can properly average each trace at the same time points. It should correspond to the lowest framerate you have in your videos.

###### Features
This is where we define what it is actually computed.
- `SHIFT_TIME`: This is to shift all times so that the stim onset is at time 0.
- `BODYPARTS`: Bodyparts of the DLC files that are actually used in the analysis. Anything that is not in there will be discarded, so it needs to contain all bodyparts used to compute features.
- `FEATURES_NORM`: tuple of 'features'. Elements in here will be normalized by subtracting their pre-stimulation mean.
- `NSTD`: To estimate the delay between the stimulation onset and the actual change in behaviour. This parameter controls how is defined the "change in behaviour". It is defined as when the value becomes higher than `NSTD` times the standard deviation of the signal before the stimulation onset.
- `NPOINTS`: Number of points above the aforementioned threshold used to make a linear fit. The delay will be the crossing of this fit with the y=threshold line.
- `MAXDELAY`: Maximum allowed delay, above which it will not be considered as a response.

###### Data cleaning
This is where we handle tracking errors. DLC files come with a likelihood for each bodypart in each frame, ranging from 0 to 1. The latter means the model is 100% sure the bodypart was correctly assigned, the former means the opposite. If we keep low-likelihood values, we'll end up with artifacts in the computed features, so we need to get rid of them. If there are not too much, missing data can be interpolated to reconstruct a legit time serie, in some extent. Otherwise, the trial need to be discarded.
- `LH_THRESH`: Likelihood below this will be considered as missing data.
- `LH_PERCENT`: If a trace has more than this fraction of missing data, the whole trial is dropped and not used in the analysis.
- `LH_CONSECUTIVE`: If a trace has more than this amount of consecutive frames with missing data, the whole trial is dropped and not used in the analysis.
- `INTERP_METHOD`: Corresponds to the `method` parameter of [`pandas.DataFrame.interpolate`](https://pandas.pydata.org/pandas-docs/stable/reference/api/pandas.DataFrame.interpolate.html#pandas.DataFrame.interpolate). Typically "linear" or "cubic", defines the order of the interpolation method.

###### Display
Those are graphs options, such as human-readable labels and so on.
- `XLIM`: 2-elements list or None or empty list. Controls the x limits on the time series plot.
- `XLABEL_LINE`: x axis label for time series plots.
- `FEATURES_LABELS`: dict mapping a 'feature' to a name shown in the graphs.
- `FEATURES_YLIM`: dict mapping a 'feature' to a y-axis range. The latter should be a 2-element list `[ymin, ymax]`. To make the graphs auto-adjust their axes, use an empty dictionary `{}`.
- `FEATURES_OFF` : list of features that will not be plotted.

##### The Config class
This is the object that will be instantiated in the main script. It reads the global variables defined above to make them available in the script, but especially defines the actual features and metrics computation. Some of its methods (functions attached to the Config object) must exist. Below is the description of each components of that class.
The required methods are :
- \_\_init()\_\_
- read_setting()
- setup_time()
- get_pixel_size()
- get_features()
- write_parameters_file()
- preprocess_df()

###### \_\_init()\_\_
This function is executed when one creates a Config object. It takes as argument a settings.toml file to fill the timings attribute. If no settings.toml file is passed, the timings are read from the global variables.
###### read_setting()
This just reads a value corresponding to a key in the `settings` dictionary, if the key is missing, return the fallback value.
###### setup_time()
This creates the common time vector on which all trials are aligned to be averaged properly. If time-shifting is enabled, it takes care of that too.
###### get_pixel_size()
This is where the pixel size is read from the settings file. It is updated for each animal so that one can provide different pixel sizes for each animals. If the animal does not have an entry in the settings.toml file, the default one is used. If it does not exist either or no settings.toml file was used, the global variable is used instead.
###### get_features()
This is the main piece, where the actual computations are defined !
- `features`: dict mapping a key to a function. This is where the features computation actually happens. It maps a 'feature' to a function. It is in the form `{feature: fun(df)}`. 'feature' is an arbitrary name that will end up in the summary CSV generated at the end of the analysis, so it should be somewhat explicit. It will also be used to link each feature to other parameters (metrics, ... -- see below).
  The function 'fun' should take as input a pandas DataFrame as returned when reading a DLC file with pandas and return a 1D vector with feature values. 'fun' can be directly defined in the dict with lambda function (as in "jaw.py"), or with functions defined at the bottom of the configuration file (as in "openfield.py").
  - if you need a bodypart directly, you can simply map it to the feature : `{"feature_name": lambda df: df["bodypart", "x"]}`. 
  - if you have simple calculation to do, you can directly define it in the dictionary : `{"feature_name": lambda df: df["bodypart1", "x"] - df["bodypart2", "x"]}`.
  - if you have more complex operations to do, for instance that require intermediate values to be computed, you can wrap it up in a function defined afterwards : `{"feature_name": lambda df: self.my_fun(df)}`. Then you need to define `my_fun` as a method. `my_fun` can in turn call any other user-defined functions, as long as it returns a 1D vector in the end.
  
In the following variables, each feature is referred to by its key in the `features` dictionary.

- `features_metrics`: dict mapping a 'feature' to another dict. The latter maps a metric name to a function that returns a scalar from a 1D vector. This is the metric used to quantify the change during the stimulation. The operations will be applied to each 'features' during the time range specified in `features_metrics_range` (see below). It should return a scalar, so we have a scalar associated to each trial. Those scalars are then represented as bar plots next to the time series. Each feature can have any number of metrics to show on the side.
- `features_metric_range`: same structure as `features_metrics`, but mapping to 2-elements lists defininig the time range in which the metric defined above is computed. The units should be the same as `clip_duration`, and expressed _before_ time shifting (see `SHIFT_TIME`), eg. timings as in the original video clips.
- `features_metrics_share`: same structure as `features_metrics`, but mapping to a boolean (True/False). It specifies whether the metric should share its y-axis with the feature time serie (eg. the feature and the metric are in the same units and range).
- `features_labels` : just reads the `FEATURES_LABELS` global variable, specify the name displayed on the y axis of the features time series.

###### write_parameters_file()
This just takes a bunch of the configuration parameters and write them to a text file for reference.

###### preprocess_df()
It should take as input a DataFrame and return the same DataFrame (with same columns and index). This is used to mark some time steps as missing, when custom criteria are met, independently of the likelihood. This exists because DLC can confidently place markers in wrong places. It can be specific to your data, eg. have hardcoded DLC bodyparts. Practically, the function should scan the DataFrame, spotting weird values and replace them with `np.nan`. Then, the main script will consider it as missing and the values will be interpolated, if able (based on dropping criteria, see the [Data cleaning section](#data-cleaning)).

#### The settings.toml file
A template file is provided in the `resources` folder. It can be copied next to the DLC files to be analysed to specify the experiments parameters, including :
- `clip_duration` : duration of video clips in time units (typically seconds).
- `stim_time` : two-elements list with onset and offset times of the stimulation (in the same units as `clip_duration`).
- `framerate ` : framerate of the common time vector used to align all time series.

Then, you have a `[default]` section, which (for now) contains only the pixel size.
Finally, you can have any number of sections corresponding to animals ID, containing, as well, only the pixel size. This allows one to specify a different pixel size for each animal. The logic is the following :
- If a settings.toml file is found next to the files to be analyzed, then the timings values are read from there and used for the whole analysis. If a field is missing, it fallbacks to the global variables in the configuration file.
- For a given animal, pixel size is read from its section in the settings.toml file. If the animal does not have a section, the value in the `[default]` is used. If it does not exist either, the global variable in the configuration file is used.
- If no settings.toml file is found during analysis, the global variables in the configuration file are used.

#### The plot configuration file
This is a TOML file specifying various display options. Generated graphs use it to set their line colors, axes color and thickness, style, etc. Everything could be modified in post-production in a vector graphics editor software such as [Inkscape](https://inkscape.org/), but this file can allow you to spend a whole lot less time editing your graphs.

As a TOML file, it has sections declared by brackets (`[section name]`), followed by entries declared with an equal (`something = anything`). Most Python types are supported, eg. strings (`"strings"`), scalars (`5.25`, `8`), booleans (`true`, `false`) and lists (`[0.7961, 0.9451, 0.9961]`). The file is extensively documented, which means each lines is explained with comments (`# a comment`).

Basically, this controls line colors, transparency, width for each type of trace (per-trial, per-animal, per-condition and pooled). It further specifies the properties of the stimulation representation (color, transparency and name in the legend). It also controls the bar plots properties (bars face and edges colors, and error bar cap size). Finally, it sets the axes properties (the x and y axes thickness, number of ticks, font family and size, whether to display the grid and arrows at the tip of axes and figure size).

For line colors : sometimes it's unique (eg. for trials that are all plotted in the same colors, or the pooled average which is unique), so the color is a three-element list giving the R, G, B values of the line. For others, it requires a color per elements that are plotted. For instance, if I have 2 conditions, the conditions color must be a list of 2 3-elements list, for instance `color=[[0.7961, 0.9451, 0.9961], [0.15, 0.2544, 0.7660]]`. The first condition will be associated to the first RGB color, and so on. When we don't know the number of elements that will be plotted, or we don't want to manually select the colors, we can use colormaps or palette. They are referred to with a name and all matplotlib's colormaps are available in its [documentation](https://matplotlib.org/stable/users/explain/colors/colormaps.html#sequential). One should then specify the color or palette as `color="name_of_colormap"`.

#### Outputs
Upon completion, several files are saved if an output directory was specified. Note that if files with the same names previously existed in this directory, they will be overwritten without warning.

Each generated figures are saved as svg (editable vector graphics). They are saved as you see them on the screen, so if for instance the figures are too small and the text are overlapping, it will propagate to the svg files. You can optionally resize the figure and save it again from the figure's graphical interface, or modify the options in the [plot configuration file](#6. The plot configuration file).

Along with the figures, you'll find two log files : `dropped.txt` and `used.txt`. The former contains the files that were dropped because there were too much missing data (based on the likelihood criteria set in the configuration file, see the [Data cleaning section](#data-cleaning)). Conversely, the `used.txt` contains the files that were used in the analysis. This excludes the files from `dropped.txt` along with the ones that were not assigned to a condition. In that case, a warning message is issued in the console.

A summary CSV file is saved, called `features.csv`. It contains each features' time series for each trials, giving the trial number, the trial ID, the condition, the filename and the animal. Metrics (`metrics.csv`), delays and responses (`response_{feature_name}`) are saved as well. Statistics summary are saved for each metrics, delays and response are saved as well.

Last, a parameters file tracks the parameters used for this analysis.

## Tips
- if there is an error, read the error message. Often, it might indicate what went wrong (for instance, could not locate a file, no data, etc.).
- any search engine or LLMs are your best friend when it comes to programs and code. Copy/pasting error messages might give you insights.
